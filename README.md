# BIDIR / LOS Android App Code

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/bb/losbidir/bidir-mobile/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=ZtqeIdfC1j)](https://codecov.io/bb/losbidir/bidir-mobile)

Source code for the Android project. There are two repositories for the project, located at two
different locations:

a) ## Gebeya Gitlab Repository
This is the main repository where the official source of the Android app is hosted. It is located
at (http://git.gebeya.com/BID-27/BIDIR-Mobile).

b) ## Bitbucket Repository
This is the secondary repository where the CircleCI continuous integration platform can pull the
source code and build/test it. It is necessary as CircleCI doesn't yet have support for Gitlab.
It is located at (https://bitbucket.org/losbidir/bidir-mobile).

This document will be modified/updated where necessary, as app source code changes :)
